 * A Hamming number is a positive integer of the form 2i3j5k, for some non-negative integers i, j, and k.
 * <p>
 * Write a function that computes the nth smallest Hamming number.
 * <p>
 * Specifically:
 * <p>
 * The first smallest Hamming number is 1 = 2^0 3^0 5^0
 * <p>
 * The second smallest Hamming number is 2 = 213050
 * <p>
 * The third smallest Hamming number is 3 = 203150
 * <p>
 * The fourth smallest Hamming number is 4 = 223050
 * <p>
 * The fifth smallest Hamming number is 5 = 203051
 * The 20 smallest Hamming numbers are given in example test fixture.
 * <p>
 * Your code should be able to compute all of the smallest 5,000 (Clojure: 2000, NASM: 13282) Hamming numbers without timing out.
